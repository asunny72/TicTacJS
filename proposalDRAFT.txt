command line tic tac toe proposal

Tic Tac Toe Command line game will consist of three classes a board class, a player class, and a game master class.

The game board class:
    -will contain an empty 3x3 matrix initally

The player class:
    -will add values to the game board matrix and specify which index to add value to
    -will use command line to specify where to add value
    -will have parameter titled symbol which will set whether the player is "X" or "O"
    -within the class, I want to have a method that will ask the user for two numbers that will make up the coordinates for where the player wants to put down their symbol on the matrix

The game master class:
    -will check who wins the game
    -within the class, there will be a if statement stating that if: three in a row horizontally, or three in a row vertically, or three in a row diagonally, are are equal to one symbol, them return the statement "congratulations! the player with "+the symbol+" has won this game of tic tac toe!"
    -there will be a reset method, which will clear the game board and players...

in the main code, I plan to use the console to ask user to enter the name of player one and then the input as the name of a new instance from the player class, repeat this will player two.
    rl.question('Player one, what is your name? ', (answer) => {
      // TODO: Log the answer in a database
      console.log(`Thank you for your valuable feedback: ${answer}`);
      rl.close(); }
    var answer = new player();
